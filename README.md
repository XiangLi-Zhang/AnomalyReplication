# AnomalyReplication
This repository is just an instruction to replicate several popular anomalies in finance. 

Those anomalies have been documented detailed in Chen, Novy-Max, and Zhang (2011) and Hwang and Liu (2014). However, it is thought-provoking to replicate those anomalies myself. And it is despairing when I try hard but make no progress. To give a hand to those need, I record my mistakes and lessons here. 

I am grateful to Prof. Liu Xin for his guidance, supervision, and encouragement. Considering that Dr. Liu might assign the replication jobs to later students, I will not upload codes directly. Please refer to the doc first. And I would be glad if you email to me or star this repository.
